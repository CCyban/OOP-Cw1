- Extract both downloaded ZIP files.
- Open the extracted **OOP-Cw1-master** folder > Open the **Cw1** folder > Open the **src** folder > Open **Main.java** using IntelliJ IDEA.
- You should have opened OOP-Cw1-master\Cw1\src\Main.java in IntelliJ IDEA at this point.
- In IntelliJ, go to **File** > **Project Structure**.
